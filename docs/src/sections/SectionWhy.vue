    <h2>Why not...?</h2>
    <p>
      There are loads of Animation libraries available for JavaScript and each
      has its place. AutoAnimate is not a traditional animation library ‚Äî¬†think
      of it more as "Prettier for motion" ‚Äî it is an easy-to-implement standard
      you can quickly apply to any project.
    </p>
    <p>
      AutoAnimate‚Äôs goal is to smooth out changes to the DOM that are otherwise
      confusing to end-users. For example, when a user sorts a list with no
      animations, it is difficult to visualize how the items in the list have
      actually changed ‚Äî but with AutoAnimate the changes suddenly make
      intuitive sense. AutoAnimate was made to solve this category of problem
      via a drop-in solution with zero-config.
